```txt
A single step becomes a leap of faith
That's when you realize you started flying
So don't you ever say you're giving up ?
No, there's no looking back

'Cause we were all meant to fly
Spread your wings across the universe
It's your time to
It's your time to shine
There's a light inside of all of us
Soon you'll find that
It's your time to fly
It's your time to fly
```
